1) General Information

 When starting to use Airfoil (a tool to stream music to different computers
in the network, see http://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/), the limitations of the
Bonjour protocol (formerly known as Rendezvous) become very annoying. The 
Bonjour protocol is designed to only recognize network entities within the 
own subnet. Hence, when your computer is behind a router within a bigger 
network, it is not easily possible to access other computers outside your 
own subnet. 

 For this problem Bonjour Beacon offers a simple solution: it makes network 
entities outside the own subnet accessible for bonjour applications using the 
command line tool dns-sd. As the batch command for dns-sd is very long and 
complicated, Bonjour Beacon supports the user with an intuitive graphical 
user interface.
